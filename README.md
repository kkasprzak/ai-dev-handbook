# ai-dev-handbook

**A guide to my everyday programming with AI.**
This repository is a living collection of my notes, patterns, practices, and experiments as I continuously explore and learn how to use AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, and others) in TDD, pair programming, refactoring, and other areas of software craftsmanship.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to share my personal journey of learning and experimenting with AI in software development. It's not a finished product‚Äîit's a work in progress, reflecting my ongoing exploration and discovery.

## Daily AI Retrospectives

Inside the [`daily_retrospective/`](./daily_retrospective) directory, you‚Äôll find a chronological collection of my daily notes and reflections on using AI assistants in real-world software development. Each file documents a single day‚Äôs experience, including:

- What I experimented with or learned about AI-assisted coding that day
- What worked well and what was challenging
- Key observations and takeaways
- How I plan to apply these lessons in the future

These retrospectives cover a wide range of topics, such as:
- Using AI for TDD, refactoring, and pair programming
- Integrating AI into daily workflows and project automation
- Real examples of prompts, feedback cycles, and code review with AI
- Lessons learned from both successes and failures
- Insights on how to get the most value from AI tools, and where human expertise is still essential

> **Note:** These are very raw, unedited brain dumps straight from my head. They are not polished or reworked in any way, so they may not always be super insightful‚Äîplease don‚Äôt take them too literally!

**What can you learn?**
- Practical, honest insights into the strengths and limitations of AI coding assistants
- Tips for effective prompting, feedback, and collaboration with AI
- Patterns and anti-patterns for integrating AI into your own development process
- Inspiration for your own experiments with AI in software craftsmanship

Each retrospective is written in English and includes real examples, images, and links to relevant resources. Whether you‚Äôre new to AI-assisted programming or looking to deepen your practice, these notes offer a transparent look at the day-to-day reality of working with AI as a developer.
