# ai-dev-handbook

**A guide to my everyday programming with AI.**
This repository is a living collection of my notes, patterns, practices, and experiments as I continuously explore and learn how to use AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, and others) in TDD, pair programming, refactoring, and other areas of software craftsmanship.

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to share my personal journey of learning and experimenting with AI in software development. It's not a finished product‚Äîit's a work in progress, reflecting my ongoing exploration and discovery.

## Daily AI Retrospectives

Inside the [`daily_retrospective/`](./daily_retrospective) directory, you‚Äôll find a chronological collection of my daily notes and reflections on using AI assistants in real-world software development. Each file documents a single day‚Äôs experience, including:

- What I experimented with or learned about AI-assisted coding that day
- What worked well and what was challenging
- Key observations and takeaways
- How I plan to apply these lessons in the future

These retrospectives cover a wide range of topics, such as:

- Using AI for TDD, refactoring, and pair programming
- Integrating AI into daily workflows and project automation
- Real examples of prompts, feedback cycles, and code review with AI
- Lessons learned from both successes and failures
- Insights on how to get the most value from AI tools, and where human expertise is still essential

> **Note:** These are very raw, unedited brain dumps straight from my head. They are not polished or reworked in any way, so they may not always be super insightful‚Äîplease don‚Äôt take them too literally!

**What can you learn?**

- Practical, honest insights into the strengths and limitations of AI coding assistants
- Tips for effective prompting, feedback, and collaboration with AI
- Patterns and anti-patterns for integrating AI into your own development process
- Inspiration for your own experiments with AI in software craftsmanship

Each retrospective is written in English and includes real examples, images, and links to relevant resources. Whether you‚Äôre new to AI-assisted programming or looking to deepen your practice, these notes offer a transparent look at the day-to-day reality of working with AI as a developer.

## MCP Integrations & Extensions

Inside the [`mcp-integrations.md`](./mcp-integrations.md) file, you'll find a structured catalog of all Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, extensions, and integrations I use, evaluate, or plan to test. This table documents:

- The name and description of each MCP integration
- Its current status in my workflow (e.g., daily use, evaluating, occasionally, to try)
- A note explaining its purpose, value, or the assumption I'm testing
- Direct links to official documentation or repositories for each MCP

This file is designed to:

- Track which MCPs are actively shaping my AI-assisted development workflow
- Record assumptions and hypotheses about new tools before and after testing
- Serve as a reference for anyone interested in connecting AI agents to external systems, tools, or data sources using the MCP standard

**What can you learn?**

- Which MCP integrations are most valuable in my real-world AI-driven development
- The evolving landscape of MCP-enabled tools

Whether you're looking for inspiration on which MCPs to try, or want to see how an AI developer manages and evaluates integrations, this file provides a transparent, evolving snapshot of my MCP ecosystem.
