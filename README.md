# ai-dev-handbook

**A guide to my everyday programming with AI.**  
This repository is a living collection of my notes, patterns, practices, and experiments as I continuously explore and learn how to use AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, and others) in TDD, pair programming, refactoring, and other areas of software craftsmanship.
