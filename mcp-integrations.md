# My MCP Integrations & Extensions

_A personal catalog of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, extensions, and integrations I use, test, or plan to try. MCP enables AI applications to connect to external systems, tools, and workflows in a standardized way—think of it as a “USB-C port” for AI apps._

| [Atlassian MCP](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian)                                           | Integration for JIRA and other Atlassian products.                   | Daily use    | Used to fetch ticket information and log work time directly in the ticket. Essential for passing requirements and ticket descriptions to Claude Code before starting work on a feature. This MCP is a core part of my daily workflow.                                                                                                            |
| [Figma MCP](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/32132100833559-Guide-to-the-Dev-Mode-MCP-Server) | Connects Figma design context to AI agents.                          | Evaluating   | Used when starting work on a new feature, especially on the frontend. I believe it provides valuable context beyond the ticket description, but its value is still being validated. Used less frequently (about once a week), depending on how often I start new features. On the backend, it's helpful; on the frontend, it's almost essential. |
| [Context7 MCP](https://context7.com/)                                                                 | Documentation server for libraries, frameworks, and custom projects. | Evaluating   | Currently used to ensure Claude Code correctly applies Hamcrest in tests. I am also considering adding project documentation to provide Claude Code with more accurate project-specific context.                                                                                                                                                 |
| [Postgres MCP](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp)                                            | Exposes PostgreSQL database structure to AI agents.                  | Occasionally | Used when I want Claude Code to understand the database schema. Otherwise, it tries to infer structure from migration files, which often leads to errors. Useful in some cases, so I plan to keep it available.                                                                                                                                  |
| [Browser MCP](https://browsermcp.io/)                                                                 | Browser automation and control MCP.                                  | Daily use    | Now fully integrated into my daily workflow. Browser MCP allows direct interaction with my primary Chrome browser, providing greater convenience and value than Puppeteer MCP. As a result, Browser MCP has replaced Puppeteer MCP in my toolset.                                                                                                |
| [Ref Tools MCP](https://ref.tools/mcp)                                                                | Reference documentation MCP.                                         | To try       | Assumption: Ref Tools MCP can provide more effective and comprehensive documentation context to AI agents than Context7.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [Snyk MCP](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/developer-guardrails-for-agentic-workflows)              | Security scanning and guardrails for agentic/AI workflows.           | To try       | Assumption: Integrating Snyk MCP into my AI-powered development workflow will enable convenient, automated security scanning and vulnerability detection, helping ensure code quality and security from the start.                                                                                                                               |

> **What is MCP?** > [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro) is an open-source standard for connecting AI applications to external systems, tools, and workflows. It enables seamless integration—like a USB-C port for AI—so your agents can access data, perform actions, and automate tasks across your ecosystem.
