# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-09-10

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- Installed and started using Browser MCP. Works great as it connects directly to my daily-use Chrome browser—very convenient for automating real browser

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- Working with the Assistant was quite smooth. The plan → implement → plan → implement flow is now well established for me, and the AI assistant doesn't make many mistakes. Whenever something goes wrong, I correct it immediately. It's not super fast, but definitely faster than coding everything myself!
- I used Browser MCP to show the design without using Figma MCP—in this case, it was quicker. It handled the task elegantly.
- Context7 MCP was also useful: Claude Code wrote a new unit test using PHPUnit asserts, but after I pointed it to the Hamcrest PHP documentation, it immediately rewrote the test correctly.
- I also tried the "code review terror" output style after the first TDD cycle. The feedback wasn't very valuable, as it focused on stubs. It's probably better to use this style when the implementation is more complete—otherwise, it's too early for major changes.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Today I used the new command for saving the session for the first time, and I was surprised that it was able to identify specific refactorings I performed during each TDD cycle and assign them to the Debt section in the session file. It also recognized areas we discussed as needing refactoring and added them to the list. So far, it works quite well.
