# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-07-22

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- I didn't test this myself. Szymon upgraded Symfony from 5.4 to 6.4 with Claude's help. It took Claude 4 hours, but he managed. This task would have easily taken a developer a few days.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

None

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- LLM is good for tedious tasks that don't require specific domain knowledge. Upgrading a framework is easy if there are tests.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Use LLM more for technical tasks that don't require specific domain knowledge.
