# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-05

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- I connected JIRA MCP and can now pull requirements directly from a JIRA ticket.
- I connected PostgreSQL MCP and can now pull table structures directly from the database.
- I created a Claude custom command that lets me easily log work in the ticket I was working on—the whole description and time are taken by default from what we were working on.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- Logging time works great—now I don't have to invent what I did and for how long, I just type `/logwork` and magic happens—a small step but a pleasant one.
- Constantly reminding the AI assistant to work according to CLAUDE.md works well.
- Asking the AI assistant about specific things—like if it knows a certain refactoring we want to use—works well. Then it immediately proposes changes.
- It works well when we specifically name the refactoring we want it to perform. The AI assistant knows them all, so I don't have to explain step by step.
- It's hard for me to get used to not using Claude Code now—it's super convenient.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- Ask the assistant if it knows something. For example: Do you know the form template method refactoring?

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Tomorrow I want to add a new rule to [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) describing Pair Programming where the assistant is the Driver who writes the code and I am the Navigator making strategic decisions—maybe this will make it even more obedient.
