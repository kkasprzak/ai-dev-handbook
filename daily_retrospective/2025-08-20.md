# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-20

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

I finally managed to solve the problem where the directories were getting mixed up and it couldn't run the command right away.

```jsx
{
  "includeCoAuthoredBy": false,
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR": "1"
  }
}
```

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- I'm very happy with Cursor Tabs. They give great suggestions. It solved my problem with imports, which in PhpStorm worked under the spacebar. Tabs give great suggestions and the problem is solved.
- This process of working with Claude also works well. I write the code, such as the API and how it should work—just like I would in a TDD test (I did this in ApiContext when I was making a client for Bab's API), I select the fragment I wrote and ask Claude Code to create the classes and implement them. This works quite efficiently and does it just the way I want without talking, explaining, or correcting—it's a different workflow with Claude Code when I don't have, for example, a unit test.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- It's good to work with Cursor even on the backend

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Sometimes it's worth checking the configuration instead of immediately writing custom scripts—`CLAUDE_BASH_MAINTAIN_PROJECT_WORKING_DIR` works like a charm.
