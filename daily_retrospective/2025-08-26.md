# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-26

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**
- Created a "production-support-engineer" agent to investigate and diagnose support tickets. Its performance was mediocre on the first try, but I’ll test it on more tickets to see if it improves.
- Built a "code reviewer" agent for the Solidity + Foundry project to check adherence to Solidity coding conventions (naming, function order, gas usage, etc.). It was helpful and found several areas for improvement.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**
- The production-support-engineer agent failed to solve the assigned problem, suggesting a solution that couldn’t possibly work. I’ll continue testing it on other support tasks.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**
- Claude Code subagents can be useful. I’ll keep experimenting to see what value they bring in practice.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**
- Improve session note-taking: clarify the format, avoid overwriting days, and keep a separate entry for each day. It would be helpful to have a command for the assistant to read the previous day’s session notes and suggest next steps—this would help me quickly regain context and continue where I left off.
