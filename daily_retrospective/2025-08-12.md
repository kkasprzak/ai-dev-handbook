# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-12

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- Claude Code once again elegantly wrote Behat tests for new functionality in Bab
- Pair programming works well where AI is the driver and I am the navigator. I have rules for this written in [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) and the AI listens quite well.
- It also works well in a small project for practical learning of Solidity. Claude Code writes tests and implementations wellâ€”there are hardly any mistakes. The only corrections are refactoring when another cycle is finished.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- Today Claude Code went crazy again when I asked him to switch to a new feature branch for new functionality. He checked out to demo and thus once again removed [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) from the project. Something is missing in the rules because he has done this to me several times and it annoys me xD

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- It's good to write this Solidity learning project with Claude Code. However, I have some thoughts that because Claude Code writes the code, if I sat down myself, I would have some problems. I should introduce a day without AI to see how it affects my work without AI.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Recover and introduce changes in [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) so that the fuckup with switching to a feature branch doesn't happen again.
- Move the rules related to PP about when the driver can start coding from the Solidity project to Bab.
