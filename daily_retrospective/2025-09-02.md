# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-09-02

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- Nothing special. Today was a day without AI—I coded mostly on my own to maintain flexibility.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- Coding without the assistant requires searching for information online, which is time-consuming. I especially noticed this today when I had to use PostgreSQL SQL functions that I don’t use every day. It’s convenient when the assistant can suggest them.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- It’s definitely still worth trying to code on my own, at least to see which elements make working with the AI assistant more efficient.
- After reading Anthropic’s guide on Claude Code, I’d like to try Puppeteer MCP to speed up browser interactions when writing frontend code. Puppeteer can take screenshots of the page, so theoretically I can provide Claude Code with faster feedback.
