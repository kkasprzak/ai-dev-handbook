# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-09-02

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- Nothing in particular. Today was an "AI-free" day—I coded mostly without the assistant to maintain my flexibility.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- Coding without the assistant requires searching for information online, which is time-consuming. I especially noticed this today when I had to use PostgreSQL SQL functions that I don’t use every day. It’s much more convenient when the assistant provides suggestions.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- It’s definitely still worth coding on my own from time to time, just to see which elements actually make working with the AI assistant more efficient.
- After reading Anthropic’s guide on Claude Code, I’d like to try out Puppeteer MCP to speed up browser interactions when working on frontend code. Puppeteer can take website screenshots, so in theory, I could provide Claude Code with faster feedback.
