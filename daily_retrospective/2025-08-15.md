# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-15

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- Nothing new

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- I notice that I program well in a pair with AI as the Driver.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- Since AI writes code more and more often, I notice that I should also write on my own to maintain this skill. I think writing on my own strengthens my knowledge of Solidity.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- It's worth forcing myself to write on my own from time to time or set a regular slot/day for it.
