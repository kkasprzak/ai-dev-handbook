# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-23

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- Item 1
- Item 2

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- Item 1

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- Double `Esc` allows you to scroll and select a specific prompt from the conversation and rerun it.
- The `Shift-Tab` shortcut rotates between three modes:
    - Accept edits on (Claude automatically accepts everything: edits, tools, etc.)
    - Plan mode (Claude doesn't modify any files, just thinks)
    - Normal
- Running commands directly in Claude using `!` at the beginning of the prompt

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- It's worth trying, for example, to first establish what needs to be done in `Plan mode`. Once established, switch to `Accept edits on` and let it work—this saves time on constantly accepting changes.
- I thought I could also connect some mcp docker (or something else) to be able to provide Claude with output from my application's logs, which ends up in the output of running containers—this could help with debugging/checking how the code works.
