# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-06

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- After finishing a feature, I wanted to test on the demo if everything worked as it should—especially regression, to make sure previous things still work. But I thought maybe I could use Claude to hit the API and test if the sorting code works. I was really excited when it turned out that Claude, based on Postman collections, can prepare curl commands to log in, extract the auth cookie, and start creating vacancies to bid on, then check if the responses are returned in the correct order. He did everything perfectly.
- After that, I decided it was worth automating this with Behat. The little guy automatically handled those API tests. He wrote a test feature that hits the API and checks its operation. Something I've been thinking about for a long time but never had time to do myself. Claude did it in max 15/20 minutes. Thanks to this, we can have nice acceptance tests at the API level.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- TDD with the AI assistant is really going well!
- Pair Programming with the AI assistant is really going well.
- As I've emphasized many times, the AI assistant has broad knowledge—whenever I ask, it always knows. The trick is that despite the knowledge, it can't always put it together when needed xD.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- I like explaining basic principles to the AI assistant instead of giving the solution—based on the principles, it figures out the solution itself. I think that thanks to this, as we continue, it can solve problems more generally, starting from basic principles.
- You have to keep reminding it of the implementation rules in the project. I've already automated this reminder with the `/tdd-reminder` command, which makes the AI assistant identify which implementation rules it broke.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- When something new needs to be done, quickly set up Behat and write basic tests—the AI assistant excels at this. I can have something working quickly—I would have struggled myself.
