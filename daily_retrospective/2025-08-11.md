# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-11

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- I used Fathom to elegantly collect notes from an interview with Grzech and Mateusz Król about their use of Claude Code during data migration
- Based on the meeting notes and with the help of ChatGPT, I prepared a nice "Success story" post for publication on our Slack

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- Automatic transcription of the interview to text—this is fucking awesome and saves a lot of time, plus I can keep focus on the interview instead of on notes
- Writing the post in ChatGPT. I'm not good at writing with understanding and good style—the chat does it much, much better and faster than me!

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- AI allows me to cross boundaries faster, which I couldn't do before without a lot of work.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Test yourself in different areas and scale up with the support of AI.
