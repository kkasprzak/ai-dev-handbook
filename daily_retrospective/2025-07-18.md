# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-07-18

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- Claude Code

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- Writing test cases and implementing based on the written test went well
- Claude stuck well to the acceptance test and then the implementation
- Claude knows the principles of writing clean code well—but doesn't stick to them xD He has it "in his head" but can't use it without a hint.
- More general prompts work well—I don't point out which class and how to write it or which piece of code and how to refactor. I ask about the principle and whether he sees its violation in the code he wrote—usually, he quickly figures out where he made a mistake.
- I also don't try to lead him very precisely by the hand, I just give him the goal I'm aiming for and ask him to work out the solution himself—he usually manages to do it the way I want. If it needs correction, I ask him to make changes.
- Claude had trouble smoothly switching between the acceptance test and the unit test. That is, once he wrote the acceptance test, he immediately started implementing the logic in the class and forgot that he should also create a test case in the unit test first.
- Claude also made mistakes in the signatures of constructors/functions he used in the code. However, he was able to correct himself after running the tests. He definitely needs faster feedback—then he can improve more quickly.
- It would be worth refining [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) so that he can switch well between the acceptance test and the unit test—right now, he does too much class implementation based on the acceptance test.
- He could also make commits to the repo himself after finishing a full TDD cycle.
- He unnecessarily adds to the commit message that it was done together with Claude Code—this also needs a rule added to [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) so he doesn't do that.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- I wouldn't have written this faster myself—if I do it according to TDD. I would definitely have done it faster if I skipped the tests.
- It's easier for me to work in TDD when Claude writes the code.
- The faster the feedback, the faster Claude can improve.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Refine [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) so that Claude makes a commit after each cycle
- Refine [CLAUDE.md](http://CLAUDE.md) so that the commit no longer contains the information that it was done with Claude
