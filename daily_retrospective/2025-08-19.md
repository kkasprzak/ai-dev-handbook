# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-19

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- Hmmm—I don't think there was anything particularly new.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- Coding in a pair with AI as the driver works great for me.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- Collaboration with AI is working out.
- Sometimes it's better to code some parts by hand than to have the assistant fix them—it takes more time to explain.
- Tabs in Cursor work really well—they give great suggestions as I type myself. It's worth using them.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Fix it so that AI knows which directory it's in, because it keeps getting confused when running commands and you lose time!
