# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-18

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- I continued working with e2e tests in Behat, checking the backend at the API level. I started with e2e (outer look) and only then moved to unit tests (inner loop).

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- Creating e2e tests in Behat with the AI assistant is simpler and faster. He can quickly handle scenarios and write context for them. The only thing he struggles with is the quality of the code in this contextâ€”it's a bit of a mess, but it works. We'll do refactoring at the end when the whole feature is done.
- The assistant constantly has trouble running tests. He often gets lost in which directory he's currently in, and as a result, running commands doesn't always work the first time.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- I'm starting to like coding together with e2e tests, which guide the development of the whole feature. Triangulation works well, and I'm starting to better understand what it's all about.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- It would be good to somehow solve the problem of Claude Code figuring out which directory he's in so he always runs commands from the project right away. Maybe try something with hooks...?
