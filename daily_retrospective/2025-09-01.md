# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-09-01

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**

- I started coding on the frontend in React and TypeScript with the help of Claude Code, working together with another frontend developer. Thanks to Claude Code, I can do a bit more than usual.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**

- Using the planning mode in Claude Code pays off.
- I need to expand the Claude Code configuration for the frontend. Hooks that immediately run the linter and let Claude Code fix the style right away (instead of only at the end) would be useful, as doing it later wastes time.

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**

- The backend colleagues found a bug I made while coding together with Claude Code. I’m not sure if I would have made it on my own—maybe not. The insight is that you definitely need to have proper tests when refactoring with AI—just as you do when refactoring without AI.

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**

- Before you start refactoring, take Martin Fowler’s advice to heart: refactoring is changing code structure while preserving its behavior. I broke this rule, and that’s why a bug appeared—which, fortunately, our QA caught.
