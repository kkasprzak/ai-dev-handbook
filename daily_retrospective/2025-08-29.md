# AI Daily Retrospective - 2025-08-29

## **What new things did I test/apply today in the context of AI/systems?**
- I tried out Context7 MCP. Why? When working with Bab Claude Code, I often encounter mistakes when writing assertions with Hamcrest—Claude tends to invent matcher names that don't exist.

## **What specifically worked, and what was difficult?**
- I started using the plan/accept-on-edit mode more frequently. I spend more time discussing the plan with Claude Code, and when I see the plan is solid, I switch to accept-on-edit mode so it writes the full implementation. This worked quite well in the Presentation layer, since there were plenty of code examples and it could generate good solutions. I’ll keep using this approach because it speeds up my work!

## **What observation/conclusion do I take from today?**
- (you can add your own conclusions here)

## **How can I use this learning tomorrow/in the future?**
- Expand CLAUDE.md with more project-specific information. Claude Code needs to know how Hamcrest is configured so it doesn’t import functions as a namespace, and it also lacks information about global test helper functions like aRandomIdentity(). Maybe this should be documented, similar to how Context7 does it.
- I’m still missing a way to keep a list of places in new code that I should refactor later. Sometimes I intentionally skip certain solutions to move on to the next implementation step, but at the end, I’d like to have a concrete list of shortcuts I took, so I can revisit and improve them after the feature is done and unit-tested, before handing it off to QA. It would be helpful to have a smart solution for this, like a custom command, to quickly add such notes.
