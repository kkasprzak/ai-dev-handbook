# Claude Code in Practice – How Does It Change a Developer’s Work?

## 1. Introduction: Why Talk About Claude Code?

- Who am I, why this topic?
- What is Claude Code and how does it fit into a developer’s daily work?
- Goal of the presentation: practical insights, inspiration, warnings

## 2. My Work “Before” and “After” Claude Code

- A typical developer day without AI vs. with AI
- Examples from retrospectives: what really changed in practice?

## 3. Experiments and Lessons from Daily Work

- Pair programming: AI as driver, you as navigator
- Output styles: how feedback and work style change (e.g., “intimidating senior”, “junior mentee”)
- Subagents: QA, Product Owner, Code Reviewer – what works, what doesn’t?
- Automation of repetitive tasks (e.g., starting work on a ticket, managing technical debt)
- Examples from retrospectives: what worked great, what was difficult/problematic?

## 4. Project Documentation and Context7

- **New experiment:** Context7 ([context7.com](https://context7.com/)) as a tool for project documentation
  - Why? (green sticky notes: “sharing tech documentation and practices in production so we have common rules…”)
  - Separating architecture/project documentation from work process rules (e.g., TDD)
  - Potential: fast onboarding, knowledge consistency, better AI collaboration
  - What I plan to test before the presentation? (e.g., how AI uses documentation in Context7)
  - Lessons from retrospectives: need for more precise and shared rules

## 5. Model Criticality and Output Style (Red Stickies)

- **Problem:** AI models are too “nice”, not critical enough, don’t point out mistakes (e.g., “It annoys me that it’s rarely critical and everything you prompt it thinks is a great idea by default”)
- Experiments with output style: how feedback changes when the model is “intimidating senior developer” vs. “nice junior”
- Examples: better code review, sharper suggestions, more value for the developer
- Conclusion: it’s worth consciously choosing output style for the task and expectations

## 6. Biggest Benefits and Limitations of Working with Claude Code

- What really speeds up, what makes easier?
- Where does AI make mistakes, where does it require vigilance?
- When is it faster to write code yourself? (red stickies: “sometimes it’s faster to write code by hand…”)
- AI makes you lazy – how not to lose manual skills?
- Examples from retrospectives: when AI helped, when it got in the way

## 7. Practical Tips and Good Practices

- How to get the most out of Claude Code? (planning, work modes, automation)
- How to teach AI about your project? (documentation, CLAUDE.md, feedback, Context7)
- When is it worth “turning off” AI and doing something yourself?
- How to test and verify code generated by AI?

## 8. Inspirations and Ideas for the Future

- What else do I want to test? (e.g., Context7, new output styles, subagents)
- What experiments do I recommend to others?
- How can AI change our work culture and development at Boldare?

## 9. Q&A / Discussion

- Invitation to questions, sharing experiences, group discussion
